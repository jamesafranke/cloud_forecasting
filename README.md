# near real-time data driven cloud forecasting based on geostationary satellite retrievals

Improved cloud forecasting could assist in solar energy projection and satellite information gathering efforts, especially in disaster response. Numerical models cannot explicitly resolve clouds over large geographic domains. Geostationary satellites provide an untapped resource for data-driven methods for cloud forecasting. 

We employ a transformer architecture trained on a novel global mosaic constructed from a constellation of 5 geostationary satellites over 11 visible light and IR channels. Each observation channel captures something unique about the states and flows of moisture and energy in the Earthâ€™s atmosphere.
